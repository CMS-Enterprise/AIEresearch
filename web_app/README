# Demo 

Below as instructions for running the demo. 

<br>

## App Components

Open a terminal window and run commands for each app component. 

<br>

### All

* If you are using a virtual environment (such as venv or conda), ensure that is running per instance. 
* Start off all terminal instances with the code below
* For the most consistent viewing experience, use light mode (as opposed to dark mode) on your browser. 

<br>

### App

* Dash implementation of the app
* `~/aie_demo_playground/web_app/app.py`
* Access from http://127.0.0.1:8888/

> NOTE: It may make sense to use a port other than `8888`

```
cd ~/aie_demo_playground/web_app/app.py
python app.py
```

<br>

### Foundational LLM Q&A

* Out-of-the-box Mistarl7B
* Model: `~/aie_demo_playground/models/app_mistral.py`
* Page: `~/aie_demo_playground/web_app/pages/qa/qa_display.py`
* _Should_ use port `7860`
* Use whatever name you want for the log file after the `-l` flag

```
python app_mistral.py -l LogFileName
```

<br>

### Doc Upload & Query Tool

* Out-of-the-box Mistarl7B with RAG applied to whichever documents are uploaded & TruLens
* Model: `~/aie_demo_playground/models/app_mistral_rag_doc_tool.py`
* Page: `~/aie_demo_playground/web_app/pages/doc_upload/doc_upload_display.py`
* _Should_ use port `7861` for the demo and `8089` for TruLens
* Use whatever name you want for the log file after the `-l` flag

> NOTE: TruLens can only start _after_ the engine has been initiated. So it will not show up on the page's Evaluation section until after the button "Click to Upload File(s)"

> NOTE: The "Submit" button only works _after_ the engine has been initiated. This may take a minute if a lot of large files are uploaded. Currently, there is no indication on the page that the engine has loaded. For now, just check the terminal window. 

```
python app_mistral_rag_doc_tool.py -l LogFileName -t 
```

<br>

### TTS

* Mistral7B with RAG using the 2024 Medicare Handbook PDF & TruLens
* Model: `~/aie_demo_playground/models/app_mistral_rag_v-t.py`
* Page: `~/aie_demo_playground/web_app/pages/tts/tts_display.py`
* _Should_ use port `7862` for the demo and `9966` for TruLens
* Use whatever name you want for the log file after the `-l` flag

```
python app_mistral_rag_v-t.py -l LogFileName -t
```

<br>

### Medicare Handbook Chatbot

* Mistral7B with RAG using the 2024 Medicare Handbook PDF & TruLens
* Model: `~/aie_demo_playground/models/app_mistral_rag.py`
* Page: `~/aie_demo_playground/web_app/pages/chatbot/chatbot_display.py`
* _Should_ use port `7863` for the demo and `8666` for TruLens
* Use whatever name you want for the log file after the `-l` flag

```
python app_mistral_rag.py -l LogFileName -t
```

## Troubleshooting

> I cannot see a component on the site / the site is not working! 

* Try hard resetting: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `R` (on Chrome browser)
* Try opening in a new tab. 
* Try incongnito mode. 

<br>

> A component is not working!

Try restarting it on the terminal window. 

<br>

> Ports are not showing up!

Check if VSCode has changed port fowarding. See the PORTS tab next to the TERMINAL tab. Change the ports in their respective pages and re-run the app.

<br>

> My port is taken by something!

See [How to check if port is in use on Linux or Unix](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-check-if-port-is-in-use-command/). 

```
sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep PORT_NUMBER
```

This prints out (run `sudo lsof -i -P -n | head -1` to see this):
```
COMMAND    PID     USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
```

Then kill the PID

```
kill -9 PID
```

See if the process is still running, and check the GPU usage to see if it is still there. 

```
nvidia-smi
```

You will see processes in the bottom seciton.
